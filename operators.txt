 int x = 2; 				// x is a variable, 2 is a literal
 cout << 3 + 4; 			// 3 + 4 is an expression, 3 and 4 are literals, + is the operator
 cout << "Hello, world!"; 	// "Hello, world" is a literal too

 // Literals, variables, and function calls that return values are all known as operands

 /*
 operator types:

 Unary:
 act on one operand.  Example: ( - ) operator. In the expression -5, the - operator is only being applied to one operand (5) to produce a new value (-5).

 Binary:
 act on two operands. example ( + ).

 Ternary:
 act on three operands. There is only one of these in C++
